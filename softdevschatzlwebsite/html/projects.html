                            <p class = "projectpara">This program is a very simple and easy to understand use of socket programming
                            and server-client functionality. I only created this project to exemplify my 
                            familiarity in network programming and establishing server and client connections. Including
                            functionalities such as generating a unique user ID upon the creation of a username and password
                            login (stored in the server relational database using MySQL) and including functionality for 
                            withdrawals, deopsits and checking balance.

                            <img src = "../images/controllers.png" alt="Project 2" style = "width: 75%;">
                            <p class = "projectpara">For a while I struggled with reducing the haptic feedback on many of my controllers
                            that I use as vibration and related feedbacks degrade the devices internals and can
                            lead to a reduced lifespan. To solve this problem, I wrote a script in C# that 
                            disables this feedback on Xbox controllers. I was planning on continuing forward
                            and adding some functionality for button remapping etc. but then I realized that 
                            Microsoft actually has an app for such endeavors. Some time in the future I would 
                            like to alter this to link the controller as a universal controller to manipulate the 
                            cursor and not only be useful in games.
