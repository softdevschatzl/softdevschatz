                  I am a student of Computer Science from Braintree, Massachusetts who has had a fascination with computing
                  since my father introduced me to my first IBM machine. Even as a child I was
                  enthralled by the possibilities that were housed within this little metal box.
                  Now, as I am pursuing the end of my Bachelor's Degree, I am beginning to put
                  together a portfolio/resume of everything I've accomplished within this field.
                </p>
                <p class = "aboutpara">Aside from the professional setting, I am an avid guitarist, playing mostly
                  rock, blues, funk and some R&B. I enjoy snowboarding, playing video games, reading,
                  and learning about woodworking.
