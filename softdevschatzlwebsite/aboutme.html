      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my web page I built from scratch using HTML and CSS! I am a student of Computer Science from Braintree, Massachusetts who has had a fascination with computing
        since my father introduced me to my first IBM machine. Even as a child I was
        enthralled by the possibilities that were housed within this little metal box.
        Now, as I am pursuing the end of my Bachelor's Degree, I am beginning to put
        together a portfolio/resume of everything I've accomplished within this field.
      </p>
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        So far, I have minimal professional experience, but my projects speak for themselves and I believe not 
        only do I have much to learn, but also much to offer.
